# Resonance — Handoff (canonical)

**Last updated:** 2026-05-30
**Branch:** `make-it-true` — "make it true" workstream commits on top of `main`.
**Scope:** local, single-user "engagement engine".

This is the canonical, living handoff for this repo. It is auto-loaded at the
start of each session by the `handoff-memory` plugin's SessionStart hook.
Point-in-time session snapshots live in `docs/handoffs/`.

## TL;DR

**"Make it true" workstream:** the app was visually reskinned but displayed
fabricated metrics and persisted nothing the user did. That gap is now closed.
The dashboard derives every card from real DB rows with honest empty states, the
Performance page lets you enter real per-post metrics, and the weekly composer +
reply queue persist generated content into the sign-off queue on demand.

> **▶ DO THIS NEXT:**
> Verify the closed loop with real data: `npm run dev`, then
> generate → **Save to queue** → **Mark posted** → enter metrics on
> `/performance` → watch the dashboard fill in. Then merge `make-it-true`.

**The closed loop now works end-to-end (no fabrication):**
generate (weekly/reply) → Save to queue → pending count → Mark posted →
Performance → enter real numbers → dashboard reach/top-post/strategy fill in.

**Secondary next-session options:**
- **Feed the board's free targets into the dashboard.** "Today's targets" reads
  the `candidates` table, which only the Apify cron fills (can't run locally).
  The free `claude-p` board path (`generateTargetQueue`) doesn't persist yet —
  add a persistence step so the board's results surface on the dashboard.
- **Apify stack** is kept (decision: keep & improve), but is non-functional
  locally — crons need a deployed env. Improving it into a real pipeline is a
  separate workstream.

### "Make it true" — what changed (branch `make-it-true`)

| Area | Change | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| Pending count | Was filtering `status='pending'` (never written) → always 0. Now filters real unposted statuses (`draft`/`approved`). | `src/server/posts.ts` |
| Metrics source | New `updatePostMetrics` (zod-validated `posts.metrics`; the single seam the X API swaps into later) + `saveDraftToQueue` + `PostMetrics` schema. | `posts.ts`, `lib/schemas.ts` |
| Performance | Read-only table → inline `MetricsRow` editor (likes/reposts/replies/views → Save). | `performance/page.tsx`, `components/metrics-row.tsx` |
| Dashboard | Dropped fake `REACH/STRATEGY/TOP_POST/TARGETS`. New `getDashboardData()` derives reach, top post, data-only strategy insight, and real candidates; honest empty states. `formatCount` → `lib/format`. | `page.tsx`, `server/dashboard.ts`, `lib/format.ts` |
| New flows persist | Weekly composer + reply queue got "Save to queue" + "Mark posted". | `weekly-composer.tsx`, `reply-queue.tsx` |

Build green; 128 tests pass (1 skipped). The 2 pre-existing failures from the
prior handoff (`buildAlgorithmRulesBlock` stub) are resolved.

### New files created

```
src/components/ui/select-native.tsx   → StyledSelect
src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx        → Skeleton, SkeletonLine, SkeletonBlock
src/components/ui/brand-avatar.tsx    → BrandAvatar
src/components/ui/score-bar.tsx       → ScorePill, ScoreBar
src/components/charts/sparkline.tsx   → Sparkline (pure RSC, no hooks)
src/components/charts/bar-chart.tsx   → BarChart ("use client", hover state)
src/components/charts/area-chart.tsx  → AreaChart ("use client", ResizeObserver, crosshair)
```

### Known remaining gaps (not in scope of this session)

- `angle-composer.tsx`, `composer.tsx`, `onboarding-wizard.tsx` still use raw
  `<select className="border rounded...">` and raw `border rounded` divs — small
  follow-up to apply StyledSelect/Card there too.
- `buildAlgorithmRulesBlock()` in `src/lib/voice-prompt.ts` is a stub → 1 test failure.
- `src/lib/supabase/rls.test.ts` — 1 pre-existing failure (RLS isolation test), not
  caused by this session.

---

## 2. App architecture (unchanged)

- **Platform:** local Next.js app. Run via `npm run dev`.
- **Generation:** all AI calls go through `generate()` which shells `claude -p`.
  No API keys, no per-token cost. Gemini fallback wired but unused.
- **Voice:** built by onboarding interview → `voice_spec` in Supabase.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** nothing auto-posts; engine drafts, owner copies.
- **X API:** still declined (cost); posting stays AdsPower-only (opt-in, untested).
- **Constraint:** only works locally where `claude` is authenticated. Not compatible
  with Vercel cron.

## 3. Pending items from prior sessions

- **ViewCreator.ai-style cockpit pivot** (paused 2026-05-28): multi-channel content
  cockpit, no login, one-click tile grid. Brainstorm notes at
  `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-05-28-viewcreator-cockpit-brainstorm.md`.
  Research workflow at `docs/superpowers/workflows/viewcreator-research.workflow.js`.
- **x-growth skills** to wire into `buildAlgorithmRulesBlock()`.
- **3 Codex adversarial findings** from a prior session (referenced in old handoff §4).

## 4. How to run

```bash
npm run dev          # start dev server (localhost:3000)
npm run build        # production build (all routes green as of eb02439)
npm test             # 97/99 pass; 2 pre-existing failures unrelated to UI
git push origin main # push the 14 uncommitted session commits
```
